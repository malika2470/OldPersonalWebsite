                <p>I am a dedicated and highly motivated individual currently pursuing an Honours Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Wilfrid Laurier University. I am enrolled in the Co-op Program, allowing me to gain practical experience in the field while expanding my knowledge and skills. I have a passion for coding and problem-solving. In addition to my academic pursuits, I have also gained valuable experience as a Supervisor at Tim Hortons. This role has allowed me to develop strong communication and interpersonal skills through interactions with customers and effectively resolving customer complaints. Furthermore, I have showcased exceptional leadership abilities by guiding and training new employees, making informed decisions, and successfully managing high-volume front store and drive-thru operations during peak periods. My exemplary time management skills have enabled me to efficiently coordinate multiple responsibilities, including ensuring timely employee breaks. </p>

                    <h3><br>To-Do List</h3>
                    <p> • Developed a Java-based to-do list application with a user-friendly menu interface, allowing users to add, view, mark as completed, and remove tasks. Implemented the Task class to represent individual tasks, tracking their descriptions, completion status, created date, and completion date using the Java time API. Utilized data structures such as Array List to store and manage tasks, while leveraging methods such as getDaysToComplete() and showStatistics() to provide insightful task statistics.</p>

                    <h3><br>Maze Solver<br></h3>
                    <p> • Developed a maze solver program using C that reads a maze from a file and finds a path from the starting point to the end point. Implemented a stack data structure to perform depth-first search (DFS) traversal of the maze and backtracking when necessary. Analyzed and manipulated the maze data to identify the end point or report if no path was found.</p>
